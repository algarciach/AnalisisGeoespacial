   abstract = {The integration of geospatial analytics into disease surveillance and epidemiological forecasting has emerged as a crucial approach in understanding and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases. This study proposes a conceptual model that leverages geospatial data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) to enhance real-time disease monitoring, outbreak prediction, and public health response. The model integrates multiple data sources, including satellite imagery, mobile health (mHealth) data, electronic health records (EHRs), and environmental variables, to provide a spatial-temporal understanding of disease patterns. The framework comprises four key components: (1) Data Acquisition and Integration, which gathers and harmonizes multi-source geospatial and epidemiological datasets; (2) Spatial-Temporal Analysis, where AI-driven models identify hotspots and predict disease spread; (3) Decision Support System, which provides real-time visualization and risk assessments for policymakers and healthcare providers; and (4) Intervention Optimization, which uses predictive modeling to enhance the efficiency of resource allocation and public health interventions. By incorporating advanced geographic information systems (GIS), deep learning, and cloud-based analytics, this model ensures a dynamic and adaptive surveillance mechanism capable of detecting emerging threats with high accuracy. The proposed framework is designed to address challenges such as data heterogeneity, privacy concerns, and computational scalability in large-scale disease monitoring efforts. Case studies, including recent pandemics such as COVID-19, demonstrate the potential of geospatial analytics in reducing response times and improving intervention strategies. Furthermore, the model highlights the significance of community engagement and ethical considerations in implementing geospatial disease surveillance systems. The study concludes that an AI-powered geospatial analytics approach enhances epidemiological forecasting by providing actionable insights, improving early warning systems, and strengthening public health resilience. Future research should focus on refining ML models, integrating real-time sensor data, and enhancing interoperability between health information systems for a more robust disease surveillance architecture.

   abstract = {Introduction: Early reports of COVID-19 cases and deaths may not accurately convey community-level concern about the pandemic during early stages, particularly in the United States where testing capacity was initially limited. Social media interaction may elucidate public reaction and communication dynamics about COVID-19 in this critical period, during which communities may have formulated initial conceptions about the perceived severity of the pandemic. Methods: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public API stream filtered for keywords related to COVID-19. Using a pre-existing training set, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to obtain a larger set of geocoded tweets with characteristics of user self-reporting COVID-19 symptoms, concerns, and experiences. We then assessed the longitudinal relationship between identified tweets and the number of officially reported COVID-19 cases using linear and exponential regression at the U.S. county level. Changes in tweets that included geospatial clustering were also assessed for the top five most populous U.S. cities. Results: From an initial dataset of 60 million tweets, we analyzed 459,937 tweets that contained COVID-19-related keywords that were also geolocated to U.S. counties. We observed an increasing number of tweets throughout the study period, although there was variation between city centers and residential areas. Tweets identified as COVID-19 symptoms or concerns appeared to be more predictive of active COVID-19 cases as temporal distance increased. Conclusion: Results from this study suggest that social media communication dynamics during the early stages of a global pandemic may exhibit a number of geospatial-specific variations among different communities and that targeted pandemic communication is warranted. User engagement on COVID-19 topics may also be predictive of future confirmed case counts, though further studies to validate these findings are needed.},

   abstract = {Introducción La información de mortalidad permite construir indicadores que se utilizan para monitorear el estado de salud de la población (1). Esos indicadores son utilizados con el fin de evaluar, planear y tomar decisiones en los sectores de salud y de administración pública (2). El último día de 2019, en Wuhan (China), se informó sobre un brote de neumonía de etiología desconocida. Una semana después se aisló el microorganismo responsable de la enfermedad, el SARS-CoV-2 (3) (popularmente conocido como "coronavirus") y el 11 de enero de 2020 se informaba sobre la primera muerte de la que fue responsable. El virus comenzó su propagación a otros países y el 30 de enero, la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) declaró la emergencia de salud pública de importancia internacional y ante su amplio esparcimiento, el 11 de marzo fue declarada la pandemia que en la actualidad continuamos viviendo (4). A nivel mundial, en la primera semana de marzo de 2021, el "coronavirus" había infectado a 117,5 millones de personas y era responsable de 2,6 millones de fallecimientos (5). Hasta entonces, el mayor número de muertes se registraba en las Américas (1,2 millones) (6), donde el listado era encabezado por los Estados Unidos, seguido por Brasil, México, Colombia y Argentina (5). En la medición de la mortalidad se utilizan indicadores como la tasa de mortalidad y la razón de letalidad. En la tasa de mortalidad, el denominador considera toda la población en riesgo de fallecer por la enfermedad, incluidos los que tienen la enfermedad y los que no la tienen; mientras que en la razón de letalidad, el denominador considera únicamente a los que tienen la enfermedad. En el caso de las enfermedades agudas, en las que la duración de la enfermedad es corta, la letalidad es considerada como indicador de mortalidad (7) y en una situación epidémica, se constituye en una medida para evaluar la severidad (8). La razón de letalidad se hace necesaria para la planificación y para proporcionar la mejor información a las personas en riesgo. Durante la pandemia ha sido irresistible estimar la razón de letalidad dividiendo el número de muertes conocidas por el número de casos confirmados (conocida como CFR por sus siglas en inglés). No obstante, el resultado obtenido puede no representar la verdadera razón de letalidad (9) debido a la incertidumbre que existe en conocer el número real de muertes por COVID-19, así como el de personas infectadas (10). Los pacientes que mueren en un día determinado se infectaron mucho antes, por lo que el denominador de la razón de letalidad debería ser el número total de pacientes infectados al mismo tiempo de los que murieron. En concreto, el denominador completo es desconocido debido a que los casos asintomáticos o los casos de pacientes con síntomas muy leves pueden no ser evaluados y por lo tanto no identificados, hecho que hace que no sean incluidos en la estimación de mortalidad real (11). Los casos de infección se detectan mediante la vigilancia en salud pública, proceso que se da cuando las personas enfermas buscan atención en los servicios de salud. De acuerdo con la demanda que tengan estos servicios y la capacidad para realizar pruebas diagnósticas, los casos confirmados notificados durante un brote representan una fracción de los niveles reales de infección en la comunidad (12). En Colombia, desde el punto de vista de la vigilancia en salud pública, en la identificación de los fallecimientos debidos a COVID-19 se emplean definiciones para muerte probable, muerte confirmada por laboratorio y muerte confirmada por nexo epidemiológico. Sus definiciones se pueden consultar en "Orientaciones para la vigilancia en salud pública de la COVID-19" (13). La estimación de la razón de letalidad ha sido discutida en el campo de la salud pública. Los sesgos de información tanto para el numerador como para el denominador en los cálculos dificultan las estimaciones precisas. La información que se utiliza con el objetivo de calcular la razón de letalidad proviene de la vigilancia en salud pública. En principio, esta información corresponde a personas que presentan una sintomatología grave; que buscan atención médica; que ingresan en un servicio de salud o; que mueren, estas circunstancias pueden conducir a una sobreestimación de la letalidad. Por otra parte, la información tendría retrasos en su notificación que hace que se subestime la letalidad. Estos sesgos pueden ser graves y conducir a inferencias erróneas sobre la gravedad de la infección o el impacto de las intervenciones (como la hospitalización) en la mortalidad (14).},

   abstract = {Background Evidence seems to suggest that the risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) might vary across communities due to differences in population characteristics and movement patterns. However, little is known about these differences in the greater St Louis Area of Missouri and yet this information is useful for targeting control efforts. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate (a) geographic disparities of COVID-19 risk and (b) associations between COVID-19 risk and socioeconomic, demographic, movement and chronic disease factors in the Greater St. Louis Area of Missouri, USA. Methods Data on COVID-19 incidence and chronic disease hospitalizations were obtained from the Department of Health and Missouri Hospital Association, respectively. Socioeconomic and demographic data were obtained from the 2018 American Community Survey while population mobility data were obtained from the SafeGraph website. Choropleth maps were used to identify geographic disparities of COVID-19 risk and several sociodemographic and chronic disease factors at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) spatial scale. Global negative binomial and local geographically weighted negative binomial models were used to investigate associations between ZCTA-level COVID-19 risk and socioeconomic, demographic and chronic disease factors. Results There were geographic disparities found in COVID-19 risk. Risks tended to be higher in ZCTAs with high percentages of the population with a bachelor’s degree (p<0.0001) and obesity hospitalizations (p<0.0001). Conversely, risks tended to be lower in ZCTAs with high percentages of the population working in agriculture (p<0.0001). However, the association between agricultural occupation and COVID-19 risk was modified by per capita between ZCTA visits. Areas that had both high per capita between ZCTA visits and high percentages of the population employed in agriculture had high COVID-19 risks. The strength of association between agricultural occupation and COVID-19 risk varied by geographic location. Conclusions Geographic disparities of COVID-19 risk exist in the St. Louis area and are associated with sociodemographic factors, population movements, and obesity hospitalization risks. The latter is particularly concerning due to the growing prevalence of obesity and the known immunological impairments among obese individuals. Therefore, future studies need to focus on improving our understanding of the relationships between COVID-19 vaccination efficacy, obesity and waning of immunity among obese individuals so as to better guide vaccination regimens and reduce disparities.},

Otolaryngologists are especially susceptible with the elevated risk of aerosolization and corresponding high viral loads. This study utilizes a geospatial analysis to illustrate the comparative risks of older otolaryngologists across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and materials: Demographic and state population data were extracted from the State Physician Workforce Reports published by the AAMC for the year 2018. A geospatial heat map of the United States was then constructed to illustrate the location of COVID-19 confirmed case counts and the distributions of ENTs over 60 years for each state. Results: In 2018, out of a total of 9578 practicing U.S. ENT surgeons, 3081 were older than 60 years (32.2%). The states with the highest proportion of ENTs over 60 were Maine, Delaware, Hawaii, and Louisiana. The states with the highest ratios of confirmed COVID-19 cases to the number of total ENTs over 60 were New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan. Conclusions: Based on our models, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan represent states where older ENTs may be the most susceptible to developing severe complications from nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 due to a combination of high COVID-19 case volumes and a high proportion of ENTs over 60 years.},

The implementation of strict lockdown policies has had unprecedented impacts on air quality globally. This study is an attempt to assess the effects of COVID-19 induced lockdown measures on air quality in both regional, country, and city scales in the South and Southeast Asian region using open-source satellite-based data and software frameworks. We performed a systematic review of the national lockdown measures of 19 countries of the study area based on publicly available materials. We considered two temporal settings over a period of 66 days to assess and compare the effects of lockdown measures on air quality levels between standard business as usual and current situation COVID-19 lockdown. Results showed that compared to the same period of 2019, atmospheric NO2, SO2, PM2.5, and CO levels decreased by an average of 24.16%, 19.51%, 20.25%, and 6.88%, respectively during the lockdown, while O3 increased by a maximum of 4.52%. Among the 19 studied cities, Dhaka, Kathmandu, Jakarta, and Hanoi experienced the highest reduction of NO2 (40%–47%) during the lockdown period compared to the corresponding period of 2019. The methodological framework applied in this study can be used and extended to future research in the similar domain such as understanding long-term effects of COVID-19 mitigation measures on the atmospheric pollution at continental-scale or assessing the effects of the domestic emissions during the stay-at-home; a standard and effective COVID-19 lockdown measure applied in most of the countries.},

   abstract = {Background: Low-wage dormitory-dwelling migrant workers in Singapore were disproportionately affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This was attributed to communal living in high-density and unhygienic dormitory settings and a lack of inclusive protection systems. However, little is known about the roles of social and geospatial networks in COVID-19 transmission. The study examined the networks of non-work–related activities among migrant workers to inform the development of lockdown exit strategies and future pandemic preparedness. Methods: A population-based survey was conducted with 509 migrant workers across the nation, and it assessed dormitory attributes, social ties, physical and mental health status, COVID-19-related variables and mobility patterns using a grid-based network questionnaire. Mobility paths from dormitories were presented based on purposes of visit. Two-mode social networks examined the structures and positions of networks between workers and visit areas with individual attributes. Results: COVID-19 risk exposure was associated with the density of dormitory, social ties and visit areas. The migrant worker hub in the city centre was the most frequently visited for essential services of grocery shopping and remittance, followed by south central areas mainly for social gathering. The hub was positioned as the core with the highest degree of centrality with a cluster of workers exposed to COVID-19. Conclusions: Social and geospatial networks of migrant workers should be considered in the implementation of lockdown exit strategies while addressing the improvement of living conditions and monitoring systems. Essential services, like remittance and grocery shopping at affordable prices, need to be provided near to dormitories to minimize excess gatherings.},

Analytics operations typically applied to geodata are explained such as clipping, intersecting, buffering, merging, dissolving, and erasing, with implementations in Python. Use cases and examples are included. The book also focuses on applying more advanced machine learning approaches to geographical data and presents interpolation, classification, regression, and clustering via examples and use cases.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed human daily life. To mitigate the pandemic’s impacts, different countries and regions implemented various policies to contain COVID-19 and residents showed diverse responses. These human responses in turn shaped the uneven spatial-temporal spread of COVID-19. Such human-pandemic interaction is complex, dynamic, and interconnected. Delineating the reciprocal effects between human society and pandemics is crucial for preparing for and managing future epidemics. Geospatial big data acquired through mobile applications and sensor networks have facilitated near-real-time tracking and assessment of human responses to the pandemic, enabling a surge in researching human-pandemic interactions. However, these investigations involve inconsistent data sources, human activity indicators, relationship detection models, and analysis methods, leading to a fragmented understanding of human-pandemic dynamics. To assess the current state of human-pandemic interactions research using geospatial big data, we conducted a synthesis study based on 67 selected publications between 25 March 2020, and 9 January 2023. We extracted information from each article across six categories, i.e. publication details, research context, research area and time, data, methodological framework, and results and conclusions. Results reveal that the influence of stay-at-home policies on mobility decrease varied regionally, showing limited effectiveness in Europe compared to the US. The positive correlations between human mobility and COVID-19 case rates evolved through time and were highest in the initial outbreak in 2020. Public awareness generally peaked prior to the peaks in COVID-19 cases, with varying intervals of 0 to 19.8 days observed across different countries. This study summarizes the research characteristics of selected articles and highlights the need for future research to spatially and temporally model the long-term, bidirectional causal relationships within human-pandemic systems to inform evidence-based, hyperlocal pandemic mitigation strategies.},

   abstract = {Background: Studies examining the role of geographic factors in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) epidemiology among rural populations are lacking. Methods: Our study is a population-based longitudinal study based on rural residents in four southeast Minnesota counties from March through October 2020. We used a kernel density estimation approach to identify hotspots for COVID-19 cases. Temporal trends of cases and testing were examined by generating a series of hotspot maps during the study period. Household/individual-level socioeconomic status (SES) was measured using the HOUSES index and examined for association between identified hotspots and SES. Results: During the study period, 24,243 of 90,975 residents (26.6%) were tested for COVID-19 at least once; 1498 (6.2%) of these tested positive. Compared to other rural residents, hotspot residents were overall younger (median age: 40.5 vs 43.2), more likely to be minorities (10.7% vs 9.7%), and of higher SES (lowest HOUSES [SES] quadrant: 14.6% vs 18.7%). Hotspots accounted for 30.1% of cases (14.5% of population) for rural cities and 60.8% of cases (27.1% of population) for townships. Lower SES and minority households were primarily affected early in the pandemic and higher SES and non-minority households affected later. Conclusion: In rural areas of these four counties in Minnesota, geographic factors (hotspots) play a significant role in the overall burden of COVID-19 with associated racial/ethnic and SES disparities, of which pattern differed by the timing of the pandemic (earlier in pandemic vs later). The study results could more precisely guide community outreach efforts (e.g., public health education, testing/tracing, and vaccine roll out) to those residing in hotspots.},

   abstract = {Objective: To perform a geospatial and temporal trend analysis for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Midwest community to identify and characterize hot spots for COVID-19. Participants and Methods: We conducted a population-based longitudinal surveillance assessing the semimonthly geospatial trends of the prevalence of test confirmed COVID-19 cases in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from March 11, 2020, through October 31, 2020. As urban areas accounted for 84% of the population and 86% of all COVID-19 cases in Olmsted County, MN, we determined hot spots for COVID-19 in urban areas (Rochester and other small cities) of Olmsted County, MN, during the study period by using kernel density analysis with a half-mile bandwidth. Results: As of October 31, 2020, a total of 37,141 individuals (30%) were tested at least once, of whom 2433 (7%) tested positive. Testing rates among race groups were similar: 29% (black), 30% (Hispanic), 25% (Asian), and 31% (white). Ten urban hot spots accounted for 590 cases at 220 addresses (2.68 cases per address) as compared with 1843 cases at 1292 addresses in areas outside hot spots (1.43 cases per address). Overall, 12% of the population residing in hot spots accounted for 24% of all COVID-19 cases. Hot spots were concentrated in neighborhoods with low-income apartments and mobile home communities. People living in hot spots tended to be minorities and from a lower socioeconomic background. Conclusion: Geographic and residential risk factors might considerably account for the overall burden of COVID-19 and its associated racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities. Results could geospatially guide community outreach efforts (eg, testing/tracing and vaccine rollout) for populations at risk for COVID-19.},

   abstract = {This study entailed a review of 63 scientific articles on geospatial and spatial-statistical analysis of the geographical dimension of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The diversity of themes identified in this paper can be grouped into the following categories of disease mapping: spatiotemporal analysis, health and social geography, environmental variables, data mining, and web-based mapping. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 is essential for its mitigation, as it helps to clarify the extent and impact of the pandemic and can aid decision making, planning and community action. Health geography highlights the interaction of public health officials, affected actors and first responders to improve estimations of disease propagation and likelihoods of new outbreaks. Attempts at interdisciplinary correlation examine health policy interventions for the siting of health/sanitary services and controls, mapping/tracking of human movement, formulation of appropriate scientific and political responses and projection of spatial diffusion and temporal trends. This review concludes that, to fight COVID-19, it is important to face the challenges from an interdisciplinary perspective, with proactive planning, international solidarity and a global perspective. This review provides useful information and insight that can support future bibliographic queries, and also serves as a resource for understanding the evolution of tools used in the management of this major global pandemic of the 21 Century. It is hoped that its findings will inspire new reflections on the COVID-19 pandemic by readers.},

Geographic Information System (GIS) based spatial models can be helpful for better understanding of different factors that have triggered COVID-19 spread at district level in India. In the present study, 19 variables were considered that can explain the variability of the disease. Different spatial statistical techniques were used to describe the spatial distribution of COVID-19 and identify significant clusters. Spatial lag and error models (SLM and SEM) were employed to examine spatial dependency, geographical weighted regression (GWR) and multi-scale GWR (MGWR) were employed to examine at local level. The results show that the global models perform poorly in explaining the factors for COVID-19 incidences. MGWR shows the best-fit-model to explain the variables affecting COVID-19 (R2= 0.75) with lowest AICc value. Population density, urbanization and bank facility were found to be most susceptible for COVID-19 cases. These indicate the necessity of effective policies related to social distancing, low mobility. Mapping of different significant variables using MGWR can provide significant insights for policy makers for taking necessary actions.},

West Java is Indonesia’s most populous province and has a high susceptibility to the transmission of the disease, resulting in a significant number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, this research aimed to determine the influencing factors as well as the spatial and temporal distribution of COVID-19 in West Java. Data on COVID-19 cases in West Java obtained from PIKOBAR were used. Spatial distribution was described using a choropleth, while the influencing factors were evaluated with regression analysis. To determine whether COVID-19s policies and events affected its temporal distribution, the cases detected were graphed daily or biweekly with information on those two variables. Furthermore, the cumulative incidence was described in the linear regression analysis model as being significantly influenced by vaccinations and greatly elevated by population density. The biweekly chart had a random pattern with sharp decreases or spikes in cumulative incidence changes. Spatial and temporal analysis helps greatly in understanding distribution patterns and their influencing factors, specifically at the beginning of the pandemic.

Therefore, this study aims to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing and its relationship with the environmental factors. Based on the incidences of new local COVID-19 cases in Beijing from June 11 to July 5, the spatial clustering characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing was investigated using spatial autocorrelation analysis. The relation between COVID-19 cases and environmental factors was assessed using the Spearman correlation analysis. Finally, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to explore the influence of environmental factors on the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases. The results showed that the development of COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing from June 11 to July 5 could be divided into two stages. The first stage was the outward expansion from June 11 to June 21, and the second stage (from June 22 to July 5) was the growth of the transmission in areas with existing previous cases. In addition, there was a ring of low value clusters around the Xinfadi market. This area was the key area for prevention and control. Population density and distance to Xinfadi market were the most critical factors that explained the pandemic development. The findings of this study can provide useful information for the global fighting against COVID-19.},

SARS-CoV-2 is highly lethal in older adults (>65 years old) and in cases with underlying medical conditions, including chronic respiratory diseases, immunosuppression, and cardio-metabolic diseases, including severe obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. The course of the COV-19 pandemic in Mexico has led to many fatal cases in younger patients attributable to cardio-metabolic conditions. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to perform an early spatial epemiological analysis for the COV-19 outbreak in Mexico. Firstly, to evaluate how mortality risk from COV-19 among tested indivuals (MRt) is geographically distributed and secondly, to analyze the association of spatial predictors of MRt across different states in Mexico, controlling for the severity of the disease. Among health-related variables, diabetes and obesity were positively associated with COV-19 fatality. When analyzing Mexico as a whole, we entified that both the percentages of external and internal migration had positive associations with early COV-19 mortality risk with external migration having the second-highest positive association. As an indirect measure of urbanicity, population density, and overcrowding in households, the physicians-to-population ratio has the highest positive association with MRt. In contrast, the percentage of indivuals in the age group between 10 to 39 years had a negative association with MRt. Geographically, Quintana Roo, Baja California, Chihuahua, and Tabasco (until April 2020) had higher MRt and standardized mortality ratios, suggesting that risks in these states were above what was nationally expected. Additionally, the strength of the association between some spatial predictors and the COV-19 fatality risk varied by zone.},

   abstract = {The world has now facing a health crisis due to outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). The numbers of infection and death have been rapidly increasing which result in a serious threat to the social and economic crisis. India as the second most populous nation of the world has also running with a serious health crisis, where more than 8,300,500 people have been infected and 123,500 deaths due to this deadly pandemic. Therefore, it is urgent to highlight the spatial vulnerability to identify the area under risk. Taking India as a study area, a geospatial analysis was conducted to identify the hotspot areas of the COVID-19. In the present study, four factors naming total population, population density, foreign tourist arrivals to India and reported confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were taken as responsible factors for detecting hotspot of the novel coronavirus. The result of spatial autocorrelation showed that all four factors considered for hotspot analysis were clustered and the results were statistically significant (p value < 0.01). The result of Getis-Ord Gi* statistics revealed that the total population and reported COVID-19 cases have got high priority for considering hotspot with greater z-score (> 3 and > 0.7295 respectively). The present analysis reveals that the reported cases of COVID-19 are higher in Maharashtra, followed by Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The spatial result and geospatial methodology adopted for detecting COVID-19 hotspot in the Indian subcontinent can help implement strategies both at the macro and micro level. In this regard, social distancing, avoiding social meet, staying at home, avoiding public transport, self-quarantine and isolation are suggested in hotspot zones; together with, the international support is also required in the country to work jointly for mitigating the spread of COVID-19.},

This study investigates the mechanism of COVID-19 transmission in different periods within and between cities in China to better understand the nature of the outbreak. We use Moran’s I, a measure of spatial autocorrelation, to examine the spatial dependency of COVID-19 and a dynamic spatial autoregressive model to explore the transmission mechanism. We find that the spatial dependency of COVID-19 decreased over time and that the transmission of the disease could be divided into three distinct stages: an eruption stage, a stabilization stage, and a declination stage. The infection rate between cities was close to one-third of the infection rate within cities at the eruption stage, while it reduced to zero at the declination stage. We also find that the infection rates within cities at the eruption stage and declination stage were similar. China’s policies for controlling the spread of the epidemic, specifically with respect to limiting inter-city mobility and implementing intra-city travel restrictions (social isolation), were most effective in reducing the viral transmission of COVID-19. The findings from this study indicate that the elimination of inter-city mobility had the largest impact on controlling disease transmission.},

Methods: A spatiotemporal analysis of COVID-19 daily confirmed cases by 250 districts in South Korea from January 20 to May 31, 2020, obtained from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and each provincial website, was conducted. The global Moran's I statistic was used for spatial autocorrelation analysis, and the retrospective space-time scan statistic was used to analyze spatiotemporal clusters of COVID-19. Results: The geographical distribution showed strong spatial autocorrelation, with a global Moran's I coefficient of 0.784 (p = 0.0001). Twelve statistically significant spatiotemporal clusters were identified by space–time scan statistic using a discrete Poisson model. The spatial pattern of clusters changed and the duration of clusters became shorter over time. Conclusions: The results indicate that South Korea's containment strategy for COVID-19 was highly effective in both early detection and mitigation, with recent clusters being small in size and duration. Lessons from South Korea should spark a discussion on epidemic response.},

Reported COVID-19 infections may not have properly conveyed the full extent of attention to the pandemic. Furthermore, infection metrics are unlikely to illustrate the full scope of negative consequences of the pandemic and its associated risk to communities. Methods In an effort to better understand the impacts of COVID-19, we concurrently assessed the geospatial and longitudinal distributions of Twitter messages about COVID-19 which were posted between March 3rd and April 13th and compared these results with the number of confirmed cases reported for sub-national levels of the United States. Geospatial hot spot analysis was also conducted to detect geographic areas that might be at elevated risk of spread based on both volume of tweets and number of reported cases. Results Statistically significant aberrations of high numbers of tweets were detected in approximately one-third of US states, most of which had relatively high proportions of rural inhabitants. Geospatial trends toward becoming hotspots for tweets related to COVID-19 were observed for specific rural states in the United States. Discussion Population-adjusted results indicate that rural areas in the U.S. may not have engaged with the COVID-19 topic until later stages of an outbreak. Future studies should explore how this dynamic can inform future outbreak communication and health promotion.},

   abstract = {Originating from Wuhan, China, COVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout the world. The transmission rate is reported to be high for this novel strain of coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as compared to its predecessors. Major strategies in terms of clinical trials of medicines and vaccines, social distancing, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and so on are being implemented in order to control the spread. The current study concentrates on lockdown and social distancing policy followed by the Indian Government and evaluates its effectiveness using Bayesian probability model (BPM). The change point analysis (CPA) done through the above approach suggests that the states which implemented the lockdown before the exponential rise of cases are able to control the spread of the disease in a much better and efficient way. The analysis has been done for states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi as union territory. The highest value of Δ (delta) is reported for Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh with a value of 9.6 weeks, while the lowest value is 4.7, evidently for Maharashtra which is the worst affected. All of the states indicate a significant correlation (p < 0.05, tstat > tcritical) for Δ, i.e., the difference in the time period of CPA and lockdown with cases per population (CPP) and cases per unit area (CPUA), while weak correlation (p < 0.1 and tstat < tcritical) is exhibited by delta and cases per unit population density (CPD). For both CPP and CPUA, tstat > tcritical indicating a significant correlation, while Pearson’s correlation indicates the direction to be negative. Further analysis in terms of identification of high-risk areas has been studied from the Voronoi approach of GIS based on the inputs from BPM. All the states follow the above pattern of high population, high case scenario, and the boundaries of risk zones can be identified by Thiessen polygon (TP) constructed therein. The findings of the study help draw strategic and policy-driven response for India, toward tackling COVID-19 pandemic.},

   abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is continuing to spread globally and still poses a great threat to human health. Since its outbreak, it has had catastrophic effects on human society. A visual method of analyzing COVID-19 case information using spatio-temporal objects with multi-granularity is proposed based on the officially provided case information. This analysis reveals the spread of the epidemic, from the perspective of spatio-temporal objects, to provide references for related research and the formulation of epidemic prevention and control measures. The case information is abstracted, descripted, represented, and analyzed in the form of spatio-temporal objects through the construction of spatio-temporal case objects, multi-level visual expressions, and spatial correlation analysis. The rationality of the method is verified through visualization scenarios of case information statistics for China, Henan cases, and cases related to Shulan. The results show that the proposed method is helpful in the research and judgment of the development trend of the epidemic, the discovery of the transmission law, and the spatial traceability of the cases. It has a good portability and good expansion performance, so it can be used for the visual analysis of case information for other regions and can help users quickly discover the potential knowledge this information contains.},
