  This study conducted a comparative geospatial analysis of COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFR) across municipalities in Antioquia, Colombia, employing six distinct spatial regression models. We evaluated the performance of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Spatial Autoregressive Model (SAR), Spatial Lag Model (SLM), Spatial Error Model (SEM), Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR), each designed to address spatial dependence or heterogeneity. OLS, which disregards spatial effects, showed modest explanatory power (Adjusted R$^2$ = 0.2085). SAR and SLM incorporated global spatial autocorrelation through lagged dependent or independent variables, respectively. SEM, by modeling spatial autocorrelation in residuals, achieved the best model fit (AIC = -704.025). GWR, utilizing a fixed Gaussian kernel, allowed for local parameter variations and yielded the highest explanatory power (R$^2$ = 0.560), though with reduced degrees of freedom. In contrast, MGWR, designed for variable-specific bandwidths, exhibited a lower R$^2$ (0.135), suggesting potential underfitting in this specific application. Across all models, altitude and population density consistently emerged as significant predictors of CFR, while humidity and urbanization demonstrated less influence. Spatial models (SLM, SEM, GWR) significantly outperformed OLS, highlighting the critical need to account for spatial dependencies in epidemiological analyses. Among these, SEM offered the optimal balance between parsimony and fit, while GWR underscored the importance of spatial heterogeneity. These findings emphasize the value of spatially explicit modeling in informing public health responses and resource allocation strategies during pandemics.
