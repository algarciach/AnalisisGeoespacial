# Notes 

Geospatial data that support health research can be categorized into four broad types, as follows.  
(i) Data about healthcare capacities, such as health facilities, employment, and administration.  
(ii) Data about the population and their health conditions and healthcare needs. The demographic health survey data, which are surveyed in many countries describing disease outbreak rates and other health indicators of the population, are often published with map coordinates of surveyed clusters.  
(iii) Data about the environment, both natural and social, which affects people's health. For example, the long standing water may affect the dispersion of malaria, which in turn affects the surrounding resident's health.
(iv) Data about transportation and the address location of patients is essential in understanding the accessibility for care, dissemination of medical supply, traffic routing, connectivity among street/road segments, transmission of infectious diseases, distribution of patients, best route and travel time, and locating a place with its postal address or longitude and latitude coordinates.
